Expand with DataCamp free cource: [Intermediate Python for Data Science](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science/matplotlib?ex=1)

1. Create virtual environment with your preferred solution. This project will use Miniconda.
You can find it from here [Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

    ```
    conda create -n learning-pandas python=3.6
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment
    ```
    conda activate learning-pandas
    ```

3. Install requirements
    ```
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```
    
4. Activate Jupyter notebook
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    
5. From browser you will see the jupyter started a server with interface. Go ahead and create a new notebook
